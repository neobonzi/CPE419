This program multiplies two arbitrary sided provided matrices using an NVidia GPU. The program uses shared memory and a tiling algorithm for increased performance. 

Run with:
./mm_cuda <input1> <input2>

To compile the cuda matrix multiplier -

With single precision float:
make single

With double precision double:
make double
