CPE 419 - Fall 2015 Matrix Multiplier Project Part D
James Bilous
Jon Doughty

This program multiples two arbitrary sized matrices using the cuBLAS library. Things to note are that before matrices can be used, they must be converted to column-major order. Furthermore, the output is column-major order but it output in row-major to result.out. Furthermore, the cuBLAS Sgemm() function does not support the use of double values in arrays, so double precision is not supported.

Run with:
./mm_cuda <input1> <input2>

To compile the cuda matrix multiplier -

With single precision float:
make single
