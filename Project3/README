CPE 419 - Fall 2015 Project 2, Parts A-C

This program builds on top of a serial matrix multiply algorithm by adding
OpenMP directives to let the compiler know where to parallelize execution.

Furthermore, the executable my-omp-env uses OpenMP functions to query the
system for information regarding number and max amount of threads available, 
number of processors available, whether currently in a parallel code segment,
whether dynamic threads allocation is allowed and whether nested parallelism
is supported. 

Compilation options:

make                    // makes both files as specified in spec.
make single             // single-precision
make single-col         // single-precision, matrix 2 in column-major
make double             // double-precision
make double-col         // double-precision, matrix 2 in column-major
make ompenv             // make program which prints OpenMP environment specs.

Execute with:

./mm <input1> <input2>
./my-omp-env
