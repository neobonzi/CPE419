CPE 419 - Fall 2015 Project 3

This program is comprised of two portions.

The first, vectorsum, takes as input two vectors and produces:
    1. A vector addition of the two input vectors (result.out)
    2. A histogram of the first vector (hist.a)
    3. A histogram of the second vector (hist.b)
    4. A histogram of the vector sum of the two input vectors (hist.c)

The second, vectoranalyze, computes several properties of the result matrix
from vectorsum:
    1. Minimum Value
    2. Maximum Value
    3. Mean
    4. Standard Deviation
    5. Median
    6. Sorted version of the array.

Compilation options:

make                    // makes both files as specified in spec.
make 

Execute with:

./mm <input1> <input2>
./my-omp-env
