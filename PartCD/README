CPE 419 - Fall 2015 Matrix Multiplier Project Part B
James Bilous
Jonathon Doughty

This program multiplies two provided matrices using an NVidia GPU. The cuda library toolkit is required. 1024 threads are used per block, with the blocks and grids depending on the input size. For example, squaring a 1408 x 1408 matrix requires 44 blocks in a single grid. This means there are 44 * 1024 = 45,056 threads working to compute the result.

Run with: 
./mm_cuda <input1> <input2>

To compile the cuda matrix multiplier -

With single precision float: 
make single

With double precision double:
make double
